# Custom Input Box Firefox Extension ðŸŽ‰
*Bring your input box where you want itâ€”smart, synced, and seamless.*

## Overview
**Custom Input Box Everywhere** is a Firefox browser extension designed to revolutionize how you interact with text input fields on the web. Tired of scrolling to find input boxes stuck at the bottom of a page? This extension brings the input box to youâ€”either as a header bar or a central popupâ€”ensuring a focus-friendly typing experience. Built for the **GDSC Summer '25** project, this extension combines innovative UX design with powerful functionality, including two modes: **Habit Mode** for seamless input syncing and **Advanced Mode** for AI-powered CSS customization.
This browser extension enhances typing UX by introducing a smart floating input box that syncs seamlessly with any focused field. It features two modes: Habit Mode for real-time synced typing, and Advanced Mode for applying AI-powered CSS customization or input summarization using an LLM API. The extension is fully controllable via keyboard shortcuts, making it fast, accessible, and distraction-free. Designed especially for platforms like Gmail where native input positions often disrupt user flow.

## Features
- **Habit Mode**: When focusing on any input box, a header bar or popup appears at your preferred position (top or center). Your typing syncs in real-time with the original input field, maintaining the website's UI integrity.
- **Advanced Mode**: Integrates with an LLM API to dynamically modify website CSS, tailoring the input experience to your preferences. It also summarizes long input fields to reduce scrolling.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Toggle the extension or switch between modes effortlessly with customizable keyboard shortcuts.
- **Seamless UX**: Designed to enhance productivity without disrupting the website's layout.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Built for performance, ensuring minimal impact on browser speed.
